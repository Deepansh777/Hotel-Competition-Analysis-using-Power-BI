# Hotel-Competition-Analysis-using-Power-BI

Many people travel to different countries and different cities during the New Year. People often spend a lot of time looking for a hotel which is affordable, fulfills their needs, not too far from the airport and so on. I am also planning to explore one of the cities during the New Year. So, I decided to scrape the hotels data from [Yatra Travel Website](https://www.yatra.com/). I extracted data for hotels in 4 different cities if I were to book them from December 30, 2021 - January 01, 2022:

- New York
- San Franciso
- Chicago
- Wichita

I used intuitive filters so that users can easily get all possible information for every hotel like  Cost, Rating, Reviews, etc. The dashboard also helps the user understand which areas have the most expensive hotels and which have the least expensive hotels. The interactive map provided will help the user to understand the different clusters formed by hotels based on cost and ratings.
